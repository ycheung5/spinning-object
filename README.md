# Spinning Shapes: Donut and Cube Animation in React

This project is a **fun, practice-oriented application** to create spinning 3D objects using **React** and **ASCII art**. The objects—**a donut** and **a cube**—are rendered in real-time in your browser and spin based on user-controlled parameters like rotation speed and screen size.

The main goal of this project is to practice **JavaScript**, **React**, and mathematical concepts like **3D transformations**, while having fun with **ASCII art**!

## Features

- **Spinning Donut and Cube:** Choose between a spinning ASCII donut or cube.
- **Interactive Controls:** Adjust the rotation speed along the X, Y, and Z axes.
- **Customizable Dimensions:** Change the width and height of the ASCII art display.
- **Real-time Rendering:** Watch the donut or cube spin in real-time.
